Local Variables means A variable declared inside the body of the method is called local variable. You can use this variable only within that method.

Instance Variable means An instance variable is a variable that is specific to a certain object. It is declared within the curly braces of the class but outside of any method. The value of an instance variable can be changed by any method in the class, but it is not accessible from outside the class.
